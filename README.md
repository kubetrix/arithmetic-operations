Plan to add below things later on.
  1) Test Cases 
  2) Architecture Workflow and Readme File Completion for documentation
  3) Swagger Documentation
  4) Authentication/Authorization(Basic or API Generated secure-id based- time based validity)
  5) Multiple Value(List) based Arithmetic Operations(Like Multiple Add etc with one API request)
  6) Multiple Arthematic Operations based on Precedence
  7) Better Exception Handling.
